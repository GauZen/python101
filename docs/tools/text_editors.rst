Text editors
************

The features a good text editor should have:

- `Unicode`_ support
      A good text editor should support Unicode. This is the de facto standard
      for cross-platform compatibility of text files. With Unicode support you
      can be sure that the text file you edited on your Unix machine can be
      worked with properly on, e.g., a Windows machine.
- `syntax highlighting`_
      In our case, the main objective of using a text editor is to write code.
      Choosing a text editor that supports syntax highlighting for the
      programming language we use helps us to comprehend the written code
      easier by applying different colors and/or weights to the text depending
      on whether the piece of text is, e.g., a string, a type declaration, or
      a keyword.
- `snippets`_
      Every programming language has certain structures for building blocks
      like, e.g., if-conditionals or for-loops. Typing them out each and every
      time is a waste of time. Good text editors allow the use of so-called
      snippets.
- hackability
      Each programmer has a different taste with regards to how they want to
      accomplish certain actions in text editors. Different shortcuts might be
      required, or a custom layout of the editor. A good text editor allows you
      to customize it to your needs, not require you to adapt to its way (at
      least to a certain amount).
- `package manager`_
      To be truly hackable a good text editor supports third-party packages
      that extend or alter the functionality of the text editor.
